What's "We're on GeeCON"?
=========================

A small joke from the GeeCON team :-)

This overlay will show a big GeeCON paw with the text "We're on GeeCON! We hope are you too!" which will hide in 3 seconds or less. It will only show when the date is "GeeCON time"!

Install
=======

**Note: It will only show between the 16th and 19th May 2012 - that's when the GeeKs hack @ GeeCON!**

Add it to your website like this if you **love** GeeCON (and get a special prize!):

```html
<!-- We're on GeeCON -->
<!-- dependencies -->
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://ktoso.github.com/were-on-geecon/date.js"></script>

<script src="http://ktoso.github.com/were-on-geecon/were-on-geeecon.js"></script>
<!-- End Of We're on GeeCON -->
```

The overlay will display for `10 seconds` and fadeOut. If you want to chage that time, feel free to do so (just for this repo ;-)).

Demo

Awesome, but how will look like on my page?

You can see a preview on java.pl:
