A small joke from the GeeCON team :-)

This overlay will show a big GeeCON paw with the text "We're on GeeCON! We hope are you too!" which will hide in 3 seconds or less. It will only show when the date is "GeeCON time"!

Add it to your website like this if you **love** GeeCON (and get a special prize!):

```html
<!-- We're on GeeCON -->
<!-- dependencies -->
<script src="http://ktoso.github.com/were-on-geecon/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"></scri    pt>
<script src="http://ktoso.github.com/were-on-geecon/date.js"></script>

<script src="http://ktoso.github.com/were-on-geecon/were-on-geeecon.js"></script>
<!-- End Of We're on GeeCON -->

```
